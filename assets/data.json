Many of my projects initially aimed to solve personal problems but have since found utility among family members and a global audience. It's incredibly rewarding to know that I'm making a positive impact beyond my own needs!\nHaving graduated from Douglas College a year ago, I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's at Simon Fraser University. I look forward to the exciting opportunities and challenges that lie ahead!"

Occasionally, I've ventured into using jQuery and Bootstrap for the sheer pleasure of exploring new libraries, even when it wasn't strictly necessary! üòÖ\nWhile my academic courses and projects introduced me to more advanced technologies like Node.js, Express, and React, I've found that my personal projects thrive on the simplicity and elegance of vanilla JavaScript and GitHub Pages. They've been my go-to tools, delivering the results I need efficiently.\nThis portfolio was crafted using vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a pinch of Bootstrap for a responsive design.",

Along the way, I embarked on various mini-projects to familiarize myself with the different iOS frameworks and guidelines.\nMore recently, I ventured into iOS tweak development, driven by a minor annoyance in the iOS YouTube app. The result? \"DontEatMyContent,\" a tweak that ingeniously prevents display cutouts from cutting into video content.\nI also got introduced to Android development through my college coursework, and that's I came up with \"BCExplorer.\" This app is all about making the most out of your stay in British Columbia by showcasing some fantastic attractions you shouldn't miss.",
